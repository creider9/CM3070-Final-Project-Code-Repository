# CM3070-Final-Project-Code-Repository
This is the code used to complete my final project for CM3070 - University of London

The first file, titled "Final Project - Implementation and Evaluation" is the file that compares multiple types of machine learning models - classification vs. Deep Learning models. 

The second file, titled "Deep Learning Analysis - RNN - CM3070 - Final Project" is the file that compares a variety of deep learning models and methods for improving the performance. It was added after determining that the RNN would overfit in the initial analysis and I needed to work through many iterations to try and improve the results. 

Data that was used for this project is located here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe
